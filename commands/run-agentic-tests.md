# Run agentic browser tests

Wraps `pnpm test:agentic` with `HEADED=1 DEBUG=1` so the dev sees the
browser and the per-iteration LLM reasoning.

**The runner auto-spawns the right oxy backend** based on each flow's
`settings.backend_mode` (`local` → `oxy start --local --enterprise` on
port 3000; `cloud` → `oxy start --enterprise --clean` on port 3001). No
port-probing or pre-start dance needed.

`$ARGUMENTS` is one or more **positional flow-name substring filters**
(OR-combined). A flow matches if its filename contains ANY of the listed
substrings. Empty `$ARGUMENTS` = all flows.

This command must be run from the root of an `oxy-hq/oxygen-internal`
checkout.

## Steps

### 1. Sanity-check the working directory

```bash
test -f web-app/tests/agentic/README.md && test -f json-schemas/flow-test.json
```

If either path is missing, exit and tell the dev: "This command must be
run from the root of an oxy-hq/oxygen-internal checkout where the agentic
browser-test layer is present (see `web-app/tests/agentic/README.md`)."

### 2. Confirm `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set

The runner exits 2 with `ERROR: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is required` if it's
unset (see `runner/cli.ts`). Fail loudly before spawning anything:

```bash
if [ -z "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  echo "Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY first: export it, or add to web-app/.env.local."
  exit 2
fi
```

### 3. Validate Docker is up (the runner needs it for Postgres)

```bash
docker info >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "Docker Desktop must be running — \`oxy start\` brings up Postgres in a container."
  exit 2
}
```

### 4. Run the tests

From `web-app/`:

```bash
cd web-app
HEADED=1 DEBUG=1 pnpm test:agentic $ARGUMENTS
```

The runner reads each loaded flow's `settings.backend_mode`, picks `local`
or `cloud`, and spawns the right `oxy start …` invocation itself. If a
backend is already healthy at the resolved URL, the runner uses it as-is
and does not respawn (avoiding `--clean`'s side effect of wiping
Postgres).

**The runner errors loudly if a single invocation mixes `backend_mode`
across flows** — filter to one mode at a time (typically by passing
flow-name substrings from the same bucket).

### 5. Report

After the run completes (or fails), surface:

1. **Markdown report path**:
   ```
   web-app/tests/agentic/.results/<ts>.md
   ```
2. **JSON next to it** (same data programmatically).
3. **Trace on failure**:
   ```
   web-app/tests/agentic/.traces/<flow>-<case>.zip
   pnpm exec playwright show-trace web-app/tests/agentic/.traces/<flow>-<case>.zip
   ```
4. **Grand cost** printed at the top of the run output (per step, per
   run, per total).
5. **Cost-budget overage warnings** — the reporter compares observed cost
   against `web-app/tests/agentic/flows/_budgets.yml` ceilings and writes
   `⚠️` to the markdown summary on overage. Advisory only.

If healing happened (`.results/healing.json` non-empty), surface the
`pnpm test:agentic --accept-healing <flow>` command and route the dev to
`/fix-agentic-test` for full triage.

## Escape hatch — driving your own `oxy serve`

When the dev wants to drive a backend they started themselves (e.g. to
debug with a persistent Postgres volume across runs, attach a debugger,
keep a created org around between runs), pass both `--no-auto-backend`
and `--no-auto-frontend` and set `OXY_BASE_URL` / `OXY_HEALTH_URL`:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start oxy yourself (cloud mode in this example)
oxy-debug start --enterprise            # persistent Postgres state

# Terminal 2 — point the runner at it
OXY_HEALTH_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/health \
  OXY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  pnpm test:agentic onboarding-blank-workspace --no-auto-backend --no-auto-frontend
```

For local mode, use port 3000 with `oxy-debug start --local --enterprise`
from `demo_project/`.

This is documented as an escape hatch only — the default
auto-spawn path is faster for routine iteration.

## CI fast-path — `agentic_only` dispatch

For the "I just iterated on a flow YAML, what's the fast CI loop?" case,
mention the `agentic_only` workflow_dispatch input. It cuts CI feedback
from ~45 min to ~15 min by skipping typos / fmt-web / build-web / smoke /
E2E / cargo clippy / cargo nextest — only the changesets gate + cargo
build + the agentic matrix run:

```bash
gh workflow run "CI check" --repo oxy-hq/oxygen-internal \
  --ref <branch> --field agentic_only=true
```

## Error handling

- **`agentic runner: cannot run flows with mixed backend_mode`** — the
  positional filters matched both local-mode and cloud-mode flows.
  Filter to one mode at a time (e.g. `pnpm test:agentic builder-edits-app
  chat-ask` rather than `pnpm test:agentic builder onboarding`).
- **`backend did not become healthy`** — `oxy start --local --enterprise`
  or `oxy start --enterprise --clean` failed. Tail
  `web-app/tests/agentic/.logs/backend.log`. Common causes: Docker
  Desktop not running, system `oxy` on PATH older than the workspace
  build (set `$OXY_BIN=$PWD/target/debug/oxy`).
- **`--enterprise: unrecognized argument`** — the `oxy` binary on PATH is
  older than the workspace build. `export OXY_BIN=$PWD/target/debug/oxy`
  and re-run.
- **Tier-2 healing happened** — the run posted a healing-staging entry.
  Route to `/fix-agentic-test <flow>` for triage.

## Notes

- Never strip `HEADED=1 DEBUG=1` from the wrapped command — those are the
  defaults that make this useful for interactive runs. Devs who want a
  quiet run can invoke `pnpm test:agentic` directly.
- Don't pre-probe ports or pre-start the backend. The runner does this
  itself based on `backend_mode`. The legacy probe-then-spawn flow was
  dead weight after the runner gained auto-spawn.
- Multi-positional filters are OR-combined. `pnpm test:agentic chat ide`
  runs every flow whose filename contains either substring.
